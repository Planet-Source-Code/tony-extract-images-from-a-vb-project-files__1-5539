## Extract images from a VB project files


</div>

### Description

You just downloaded a VB project from the 'net. But the author "forgot" to include the image files (bmp, ico, gif, etc) he/she used in the project in the zip file. Do not panic anymore! Use this utility (complete with source), to extract these images from the frx, dox and ctx (the binary support) files. You still need the frm, dob and ctl files. (For pgx and other ones, just make the neccessary adjustments in the code.) It is a complete project for VB6 (SP3), executable is included.
